This API helps you take advantage of fully web based voice infrastructure and deploy fully fledged services without the need for expensive physical equipment. Programmable Voice allows you to enrich your call experience by adding features that would have otherwise be inaccessible using the normal physical lines. Our fully featured API gives you a wide number of actions that you can use together to build intuitive solutions.

## VOIP Capabilities

Use our SIP endpoints to make and receive calls on your browser. This lowers infrastructure costs significantly.

## Call Transfer

Send a caller to another phone number or agent when the need arises e.g wrong recipient, need to transfer to a different department etc.

## Say and Play

Automatically read text information to callers using our free Text to Speech Engine. Using the play action, you can playback an audio file that is located anywhere on the web.

## Call Queues

Dynamically enqueue and dequeue callers to increase your call handling capacity. With this feature, calls can be put in a queue to be handled later or forwarded to another agent.

## Call Recording

Record a call session into an MP3 file that you can retrieve and play later. This will prove useful when conducting surveys or ensuring quality of service in call centres.

## SIP Trunking

Direct incoming and outgoing calls to a virtual phone provider or your company's private network. This will lower your call charges and reduce need for more physical infrastructure.
